# CONTRIBUTING

## PR

We take PRs on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us in the discord in the #dev channel to have your PR considered.

You will need to create a feature branch from the `main` branch, write all your code there, and then when you submit your PR you submit it against the `main` branch.

If anything else is new to you, don't feel intimidated, come and join us on Discord and we'll take the time to help.

## Components

When creating a component you need to provide a few properties in order to render the component properly. Try to avoid creating prop drilling, or even accessing react context in a component. The components should be as dumb as possible. The only place where you should have access to API requests, or React.Context is at the page level (`src/pages/*`).

In terms of standard its a good practice to first do global imports, then relative imports and finally scss imports. So a component would look something like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react' // a global import
import { Button } from '../button' // a relative import
import styles from './styles.module.scss' // a sass import

export const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div className={styles.container}>My Component</div>
}
```

There are some auxiliary components that aren't doing much besides aiding with the layout. A good example of that is the `/src/pages/objkt-display` where you have `<Container/>` and `<Padding />`. These components are similar to what `reactstrap` provides, but we're trying to minimize our bundle size, so we're reducing on dependencies.
