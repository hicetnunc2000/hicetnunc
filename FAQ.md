![Preview window](https://i.ibb.co/Xs17Bjr/preview-copy.jpg)

* Click on [mint]
* Approve from your wallet, and the Tezos transaction will go through. 

You can either check back on the homepage, or click on ‚ÄúManage Assets‚Äù to see if your OBJKT is done minting and available. Your wallet should also say "confirmed". Times vary for how long the confirmation should take, but it usually takes a couple of minutes.

Based on the edition number that you minted, you will see a number of ‚ÄúOBJKTS‚Äù in your tezos wallet. These newly minted OBJKTs now belong to you.

*At this point your OBJKT doesn‚Äôt have a price on it. It will show up on the homepage as ‚ÄúNot for sale‚Äù. Continue to the next section to learn how to set prices for your OBJKTs.*

## I press the sync button and nothing happens, what can I do?
Try opening an incognito tab or clearing your cookies/cache to restart the wallet connection. You can also try a different browser.

## How do I edit the description of my NFT after I minted it?
Once minted, you cannot the title, description, or tags.

## How to sell/price your OBJKT (swap) üîÉ

* Click on your OBJKT's link to see the details
* If you are still synced to your wallet, you should see ‚ÄúSwap‚Äù, "Cancel", ‚ÄúBurn‚Äù option next to ‚Äúinfo‚Äù and ‚Äúowners‚Äù. (If you don‚Äôt see these options, then you have to sync your wallet again.)

![How to swap guide](https://i.ibb.co/m00xpC0/swap-copy.jpg)

* Click on swap
* Input how many OBJKTs out of your edition that you want to set for sale. For example, If you have 10, and you want to keep 1, and sell 9, then input ```9```. If you want to sell all of them, input ```10```.
* Input how much each edition number should cost in Tezos
* Hit the [swap] button.

*You might have to reload a couple of times to see if the transaction went through. Times vary for how long the confirmation should take, but it usually takes a couple of minutes.*

When you are swapping, you are sending an amount of OBJKTs of your edition out of your wallet. Once the blockchain transaction is finished, the price should be set on the OBJKT and available for purchase, and your wallet should say that you sent that amount of OBJKTs. 

## How to change the price of your OBJKT (cancel) ‚ùå

Let‚Äôs say I want to lower or raise my price, or set my OBJKTs as ‚Äúnot for sale‚Äù. 

* Make sure your wallet is synced
* Click on [cancel]. This will send the OBJKTs back to your wallet. 
* Now that they are back in your wallet, you can [swap] them again.

*If you try to [swap] on OBJKTs that are currently for sale, your wallet will throw a warning saying that you have insufficient funds. This is because you already sent your OBJKTs out of your wallet in the first swap. You need to [cancel] the curation to get the OBJKTs back in your wallet, and then you can [swap] them again.*

## What is this 2.5% fee?
The fee means that when your NFT sells, Hicetnunc will charge 2.5% of the sale. It is used to maintain the server. We suggest factoring this into your sell price to cover the costs.

## I minted an NFT twice by mistake. What do you suggest I do?

We suggest waiting for the burn feature to work (we don't have an ETA of when that will be). If you just started your account and can afford to start over from a new wallet, that is also an option.

## How to delete your NFT (burn) :fire:

The [burn] button allows you to burn (delete) the NFT.

*NOTE: You need to [cancel] the curation of this OBJKT so it can be available in your wallet when you are ready to burn it.*

However, at the moment, burned tokens still appear in your wallet. We are working to update API to filter the burned OBJKTs.

*As of 3/17 this feature is not yet implemented.*
*There is a workaround where you may send the desired burned work to the burn address directly from your Tezos wallet.
The address is: tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX
_NOTE:_ The OBJKT will still stay listed on your profile, so this method is not recommended.*

## What are those little circles on each post? hDAO? What is that?
![hDAO upvote button](https://i.ibb.co/DfWqrwK/circle.jpg)

hDAO is a token distributed for buyer/sellers and can be used to compose a decentralized feed on the blockchain by making it possible to distribute and to claim hDAOs between the community. The hDAO feed filters the NFTs with the most "upvotes" (hDAO balances).

When you click on the circle, it is like upvoting an NFT. When you upvote, you send hDAO tokens to the NFT creator (The hDAOs are directed to the specific NFT). The creator of the NFT can choose to withdraw the hDAOs from their wallet, keep it, or use it to vote on other artworks. As the creator withdraws or spends the hDAOs, the balance will be reduced and the NFT will fall in the position of the feed.

An example of the info stored in the hDAO blockchain:
```
OBJKT KT1RJ6PbjHpwc3M5rw5s2Nbmefwbuwbdxton
hDAO KT1AFA2mwNUMNd4SsujE1YYp29vd8BZejyKW
Curations KT1TybhR7XraG75JFYKSrh7KnxukMBT5dor6 (hDAO-NFT wallet)
OBJKT Swap/Mintery KT1Hkg5qeNhfwpKW4fXvq7HGZB9z2EnmCCA9
```

The hDAOs appear in your profile and should appear in your wallet. 
<a href="https://xtz.news/latest-tezos-news/getting-started-as-an-nft-artist-on-tezos-using-hicetnunc/#hdao" target="_blank">Here</a> is a guide on how to have them show in temple wallet. As for Kukai, it's a matter of kukai wallet team implementing it. Right now they show up in Kukai wallet as "unknown token".

## How to find buyers

Unfortunately, there are people minting NFTs who did not create what they upload. These copyminters, as we call them, try to make a quick buck with art from other people. Collectors have to very careful and try to find out who the artists are and if the art is genuine. 

To make it easier for them, please leave a trace to any social profile or website in the description of your artwork, so potential buyers can validate the authenticity. If you can link the NFTs the artist is advertising on the profile with the NFTs on Hicetnunc, you can assume it is legit.

## How to get verified
-- or how do I get my name in the profile?

hicetnunc fetches the profile information from https://tzkt.io so to get your name associated with your wallet address you need to contact tzkt.io. They will ask you to fill in a form and to transfer a small amount of tez from your wallet to prove it is really you.

* Go to your hic et nunc profile

* A pop-up will be displayed "You can share your email and other contacts."
* Click the share link
